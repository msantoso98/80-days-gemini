# Around the world with Gemini

The goal is to circumvent around the world in 80 Days (basically Jules Verne book)

To run this:

1. Clone this whole repo
2. `pip install -r requirements.txt` (I'm using Python 3.12.2 because I can't install Google genai lib in version 3.11.9)
3. `fastapi dev app/main.py`
4. Visit `http://localhost:8000/docs`
